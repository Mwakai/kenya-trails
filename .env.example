VITE_MAPTILER_KEY=your_maptiler_api_key_here

# Since your API key is visible in the browser (anyone can open DevTools and see it), someone could copy it and use it 
# on their own website, consuming your quota and potentially costing you money.

#   Domain restrictions tell MapTiler: "Only accept requests from these websites."

#   To set this up:

#   1. Go to https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/ and sign in
#   2. Navigate to Account → API Keys (or Keys in the sidebar)
#   3. Find your key and click to edit it
#   4. Under Allowed HTTP origins or URL restrictions, add your domains:
#   http://localhost:*
#   https://yourdomain.com
#   https://*.yourdomain.com

#   Now if someone copies your key and tries to use it on malicious-site.com, MapTiler will reject the request because that domain isn't on your allowlist.

#   Other protections to consider:
#   - Rate limits - Cap requests per second/day to prevent abuse
#   - Usage alerts - Get notified if usage spikes unexpectedly
#   - Separate keys - Use different keys for development vs production, so you can revoke one without affecting the other
